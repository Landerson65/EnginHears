This is a MATLAB simulation that demonstrates adding the ski-slope filtering algorithm 
on conversations that simulate hearing loss.

The file 'enginHearDemo.m' is the main file to run the simulation.
The conversations pre- and post- filtering will be played aloud.

Several graphs analyzing the characteristics of the signal will be output for analysis.
