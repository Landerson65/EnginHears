This folder contains the Visual Studio Project Solution that includes the modular C functions.

Example implementations of an FFT, iFFT, and ski-slope filter 
are demonstrated and output to the console.

The example input data was selected because they had known FFT values,
ensuring the FFT algorith operated correctly.
