# EnginHears
LCBC Hearing Aid Development Platform

This project intended to develop a low cost, socially destigmatized hearing aid design. Despite hearing loss being so prominent, the average cost of hearing aids is $2,300 per unit, putting hearing aids out of reach of many low- to middle-income families [1]. In addition, many people who need and can afford hearing aids choose not to buy them, as their bulky aesthetic increases social stigma [2]. To combat these current market limitations, the EnginHears developed a Low Cost Bone Conduction (LCBC) Hearing Aid Development Platform.
