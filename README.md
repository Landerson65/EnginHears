# EnginHears
LCBC Hearing Aid Development Platform

This project intended to develop a low cost, socially destigmatized hearing aid design. Despite hearing loss being so prominent, the average cost of hearing aids is $2,300 per unit, putting hearing aids out of reach of many low- to middle-income families. In addition, many people who need and can afford hearing aids choose not to buy them, as their bulky aesthetic increases social stigma. To combat these current market limitations, the EnginHears developed a Low Cost Bone Conduction (LCBC) Hearing Aid Development Platform.
